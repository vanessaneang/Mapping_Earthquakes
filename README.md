# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
Create and interactive map that utilizes Earthquake JSON data to visualize the different recent magnitudes of earthquakes there are around the world. Several overlays were created for users to see all recent earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes with magnitudes over 4.5. The map includes three different styles, a street map, satelitte, and dark street map version to better enhance the visualizations. 

## Challenges Faced 
During this project the most difficult part was making sure the functions were nested inside one another properly, if they were not nested properly the final result would fail to include the data.
